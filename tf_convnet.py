# Convolutional neural networks work by miving small filters across the input image. 
# This means the filters are re-used for recognizing patterns throughout the entire input image. 
# This makes the convolutional networks much more powerful than fully-connected networks with the same number of variables.
# This in turn makes ConvNets faster to train
