## Helper functions
---
This folder contains functions to predict track time of a car run on the [Island project](https://github.com/ad71/Unity-Projects-2/tree/master/Car%20AI%20GA).

Given a dataset with the 18 deciding parametersof a certain genome, these helper functions try to predict the time taken by the genome to actually meander the track.
